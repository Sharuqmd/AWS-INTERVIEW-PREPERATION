1.Can you explain your experience with managing EKS clusters?

2.How do you handle deployment rollbacks in Kubernetes?

3.What’s your process for troubleshooting an AWS service outage?

4.Have you ever automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform?




====================================EC2=============================================

1.You have an EC2 instance running a critical web app. After restarting the instance, the app stops working because certain configurations and files are missing.?
answer 


User Data / Bootstrap Script:

Yes — EC2 User Data can automate configuration setup each time the instance launches.

To make it re-run on every reboot (not just the first), you’d modify /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg or use a startup script (like a systemd service).

Custom AMI:

Perfect. Creating an AMI after installing dependencies ensures that future instances launch fully pre-configured — no need for repeated setup.

Bootstrap Automation:

Excellent. Combining bootstrapping and AMIs makes deployments reproducible and scalable (common in autoscaling setups).

🔧 Additional tip:

For persistent data, use EBS volumes (not ephemeral storage).

Mount them on startup and ensure data doesn’t vanish on termination.
