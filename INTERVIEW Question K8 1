Question 1— Kubernetes Certificates & Certificate Rotation (kubeadm clusters)

Scenario:
Your on-prem cluster is built with kubeadm. After 1 year, your control-plane node shows certificate expiration warnings.
kubectl get cs shows API server, controller-manager, and scheduler as “Unhealthy” because their client certs have expired.
Your cluster is still running but you cannot add new nodes or perform secure communication.

Explain:

Which certificates expire in a kubeadm-managed cluster, and where they are located.

How kubelet certificate rotation works vs control-plane certificate rotation.

How to safely renew all Kubernetes certificates (API server, controller, scheduler, etc.) using kubeadm without breaking the cluster.

How to handle ETCD certificates and what to check after renewal.

How to avoid the same issue in the future (monitoring, automation, alerts).
