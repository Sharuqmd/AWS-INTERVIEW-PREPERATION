1.Can you explain your experience with managing EKS clusters?

2.How do you handle deployment rollbacks in Kubernetes?

3.What’s your process for troubleshooting an AWS service outage?

4.Have you ever automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform?




====================================EC2=============================================

1.You have an EC2 instance running a critical web app. After restarting the instance, the app stops working because certain configurations and files are missing.?
answer 


User Data / Bootstrap Script:

Yes — EC2 User Data can automate configuration setup each time the instance launches.

To make it re-run on every reboot (not just the first), you’d modify /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg or use a startup script (like a systemd service).

Custom AMI:

Perfect. Creating an AMI after installing dependencies ensures that future instances launch fully pre-configured — no need for repeated setup.

Bootstrap Automation:

Excellent. Combining bootstrapping and AMIs makes deployments reproducible and scalable (common in autoscaling setups).

🔧 Additional tip:

For persistent data, use EBS volumes (not ephemeral storage).

Mount them on startup and ensure data doesn’t vanish on termination.

2. 2. EKS Networking and CNI Troubleshooting

Question: A newly deployed Pod is constantly failing to communicate with another Pod in the same namespace. You suspect a networking issue.
What steps do you take to troubleshoot the AWS VPC CNI (Container Network Interface) configuration?

Answer: This usually points to a problem with IP Address Management or Security Groups.

    Check Pod Status & Logs: Verify the Pod is in a Running state. If it's stuck in ContainerCreating, check CNI logs.

    Check IP Allocation: Check the number of available IP addresses on the Node using the CNI's logging.

        The AWS CNI manages IPs via Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) and secondary IP addresses. If the node runs out of secondary IPs, new Pods won't get an IP.

    Inspect CNI Pod Status: Check the status and logs of the aws-node Pods (the CNI daemonset) in the kube-system namespace for errors related to network setup or communication with the AWS API.

        kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=aws-node

    Network Policy Check: If the failure is between Pods, verify no NetworkPolicy is incorrectly blocking traffic.

    VPC Security Group: Ensure the Node Security Group allows inbound and outbound traffic on the necessary ports (especially ephemeral ports) for communication within the cluster.

3. Managing State with Persistent Volumes

Question: You need to deploy a stateful application (like a database) to EKS. Explain the components required to manage persistent storage and ensure data resilience using AWS services.

Answer: You need StorageClasses, PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), and an AWS EBS CSI driver.

    EBS CSI Driver: Ensure the AWS EBS Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver is installed. This allows Kubernetes to communicate directly with AWS APIs to provision and manage EBS volumes.

    StorageClass: Define a StorageClass YAML that specifies the AWS volume type (gp3 is standard), IOPS/throughput settings, and the provisioner (ebs.csi.aws.com).

    PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC): The developer defines a PVC that requests a specific size and access mode (e.g., ReadWriteOnce) using the name of the StorageClass.

    Dynamic Provisioning: When the stateful application (via a StatefulSet) requests the PVC, 
    the EBS CSI driver dynamically provisions a new AWS EBS Volume according to the StorageClass definition and attaches it to the appropriate worker node.

    Resilience: EBS volumes can be snapshotted using the Kubernetes VolumeSnapshot API, backing up the data to S3 for disaster recovery.
