1. You’re managing an on-premises Kubernetes cluster, and developers report that:

“When we create new pods, they stay in Pending for several minutes, even though nodes are healthy and have enough resources.”

You check the nodes — all Ready.
You also check the pods — they’re waiting for scheduling.

You suspect something is wrong with the control plane.

👉 Question:
What components of the control plane would you investigate, in what order, and what would you specifically look for in each component to identify the cause of the scheduling delay?

Answer 

If new pods remain Pending while nodes are healthy, I’d first check the scheduler — it’s responsible for assigning pods to nodes. I’d look at the scheduler logs for ‘FailedScheduling’ messages.

If the scheduler looks fine, I’d check the controller-manager to see if pods are even being created correctly.

Then I’d look at the API server logs and metrics to check for latency — slow etcd or API server overload can delay scheduling. Finally, 
I’d verify etcd health using etcdctl endpoint health to ensure low latency and no timeouts. All these components are tightly coupled in scheduling flow.”

2. ⚙️ Question 15 (Node Metadata & Scheduling Logic)

You have three nodes:

node1 labeled as env=prod and annotated with team=backend

node2 labeled as env=dev and annotated with team=frontend

node3 labeled as env=stage and annotated with team=qa

affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: team
          operator: In
          values:
          - backend

Where will this pod get scheduled — and why?

Answer: 

Yes — the pod will be scheduled on node1 because:

The key team=backend exists as an annotation on node1.

However… 🧩 nodeAffinity only works with labels, not annotations.

So actually — in this exact YAML, the pod will stay in a Pending state unless that team=backend is a label (not an annotation).
