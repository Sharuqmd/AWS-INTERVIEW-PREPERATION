1. You’re managing an on-premises Kubernetes cluster, and developers report that:

“When we create new pods, they stay in Pending for several minutes, even though nodes are healthy and have enough resources.”

You check the nodes — all Ready.
You also check the pods — they’re waiting for scheduling.

You suspect something is wrong with the control plane.

👉 Question:
What components of the control plane would you investigate, in what order, and what would you specifically look for in each component to identify the cause of the scheduling delay?

Answer 

If new pods remain Pending while nodes are healthy, I’d first check the scheduler — it’s responsible for assigning pods to nodes. I’d look at the scheduler logs for ‘FailedScheduling’ messages.

If the scheduler looks fine, I’d check the controller-manager to see if pods are even being created correctly.

Then I’d look at the API server logs and metrics to check for latency — slow etcd or API server overload can delay scheduling. Finally, 
I’d verify etcd health using etcdctl endpoint health to ensure low latency and no timeouts. All these components are tightly coupled in scheduling flow.”
